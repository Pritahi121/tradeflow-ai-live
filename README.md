# Supabase CLI

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/supabase/cli/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/supabase/cli?branch=main) [![Bitbucket Pipelines](https://img.shields.io/bitbucket/pipelines/supabase-cli/setup-cli/master?style=flat-square&label=Bitbucket%20Canary)](https://bitbucket.org/supabase-cli/setup-cli/pipelines) [![Gitlab Pipeline Status](https://img.shields.io/gitlab/pipeline-status/sweatybridge%2Fsetup-cli?label=Gitlab%20Canary)
](https://gitlab.com/sweatybridge/setup-cli/-/pipelines)

[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is an open source Firebase alternative. We're building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade open source tools.

This repository contains all the functionality for Supabase CLI.

- [x] Running Supabase locally
- [x] Managing database migrations
- [x] Creating and deploying Supabase Functions
- [x] Generating types directly from your database schema

```

When installing with yarn 4, you need to disable experimental fetch with the following nodejs config.

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-fetch yarn add supabase
```

> **Note**
For Bun versions below v1.0.17, you must add `supabase` as a [trusted dependency](https://bun.sh/guides/install/trusted) before running `bun add -D supabase`.

Or using npx:

```bash
npx supabase bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command will guide you through the process of setting up a Supabase project using one of the [starter](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-samples/blob/main/samples.json) templates.

## Docs

Command & config reference can be found [here](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/about).

## Breaking changes

We follow semantic versioning for changes that directly impact CLI commands, flags, and configurations.

However, due to dependencies on other service images, we cannot guarantee that schema migrations, seed.sql, and generated types will always work for the same CLI major version. If you need such guarantees, we encourage you to pin a specific version of CLI in package.json.

## Developing

To run from source:

```sh
# Go >= 1.22
go run . help
```
